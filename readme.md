## 🌟 What Makes This Model Stand Out?

- 🧠 **Dual Attention Mechanism for Super-Resolution**  
  Combines **Channel Attention** and **Spatial Attention** to adaptively refine features and preserve fine textures—delivering sharper and clearer super-resolution outputs.

- ⚡ **Progressive Upsampling for High Fidelity**  
  Achieve **4× super-resolution** with a lightweight, multi-stage upsampling pipeline designed for quality without sacrificing speed.

- 🎯 **Dataset Flexibility**  
  Train and evaluate the model on **DIV2K**, **Urban100**, **Manga109**, and more.

- 📊 **Comprehensive Evaluation Metrics**  
  Analyze performance using **PSNR**, **SSIM**, and **VGG perceptual loss**.

- 🚀 **One-Command Training Flow**  
  Launch end-to-end training with a single command—streamlined for both researchers and practitioners.

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### 1. Installation
```bash
conda create -n dualsr python=3.9 -y
conda activate dualsr
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 2. **Download Datasets (Auto-downloader included!)**
Get all the datasets for training and testing in one go:

```bash
python download_data.py
```
### 3. **Train the Model**
Ready to train? Simply execute:
```bash
python main.py
```
### 4. **Test on Your Own Images**
Want to upscale your own images? Here’s how you can do it:
```bash
from model import SuperResolutionNet

# Load pretrained model
model = SuperResolutionNet().load_from_checkpoint("model.pth")

# Upscale your image
enhanced_image = model.upscale("your_image.jpg")
```
